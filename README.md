# Ecommerce Customer Analysis: Mobile App vs Website Experience

Welcome to the Ecommerce Customer Analysis project! 

The company, based in New York City, operates a dynamic clothing business that not only offers online shopping but also in-store personalized style and clothing advice sessions. Customers have the opportunity to meet with a stylist, either in-store or virtually, before making their purchases online via mobile app or website. 

The company is facing an exciting decision: should they enhance the mobile app experience or invest further in improving the website? That’s where this analysis comes in. Using data-driven insights, we’ll dive deep into customer behaviors and spending patterns to guide their strategy.

### Dataset Overview
This dataset contains key information that helps us understand customer engagement and spending across both platforms:

- **Email**: Customer’s unique email address.
- **Address**: Customer's physical address.
- **Avatar**: Link to the customer’s profile image.
- **Avg. Session Length**: The average length of time a customer spends on the website.
- **Time on App**: The average amount of time a customer spends on the mobile app (in minutes).
- **Time on Website**: The average amount of time a customer spends on the website (in minutes).
- **Length of Membership**: The number of years the customer has been a member of the platform.
- **Yearly Amount Spent**: The total amount spent by the customer in a year.

Through linear regression analysis, we'll uncover trends and correlations that will guide the company in deciding whether to prioritize the mobile app experience or the website experience for a better customer engagement strategy.
